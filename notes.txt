Clojure vs. Scala

Fun!

React
Immediate Mode, like repl or the unix command line
Declerative UI, describe how you want it to look, change state and let react take care of it
re-render every time, cheap re-render since react builds a virtual DOM every time you tell it to re-render
it'll do the minimal change-set and apply it to the DOM. You don't have to deal with it.

State
If you ask the same question twice and get different answers at different times you have state

Persistent Data Structure
In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. (A persistent data structure is not a data structure committed to persistent storage, such as a disk; this is a different and unrelated sense of the word "persistent.")
