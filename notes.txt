Clojure vs. Scala

Fun!

React
Immediate Mode, like repl or the unix command line
Declerative UI, describe how you want it to look, change state and let react take care of it
re-render every time, cheap re-render since react builds a virtual DOM every time you tell it to re-render
it'll do the minimal change-set and apply it to the DOM. You don't have to deal with it.


Persistent Data Structure
Immutability 

Om 
ShouldUpdate is only 

ClojureScript
