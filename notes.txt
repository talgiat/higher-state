Clojure vs. Scala

Fun!

Persistent Data Structure
In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. (A persistent data structure is not a data structure committed to persistent storage, such as a disk; this is a different and unrelated sense of the word "persistent.")

Immutability 
variables have no state transition management

React
Immediate Mode, like repl or the unix command line
Declerative UI, describe how you want it to look, change state and let react take care of it
re-render every time, cheap re-render since react builds a virtual DOM every time you tell it to re-render
it'll do the minimal change-set and apply it to the DOM. You don't have to deal with it.

State
If you ask the same question twice and get different answers at different times you have state
Value of identity at a time, some might call it variable but it's not, since they are predicated on a single 
thread of control

ClojureScript 
compiler for clojure that targets Javascript also uses google closure compiler for optimizations.

React 

V in MVC

Display logic and markup are highly cohesive, no reason to seperate them and compromise for a poor's man 
programming language. 

React builds a new virtual DOM subtree
…diffs it with the old one
…computes the minimal set of DOM mutations and puts them in a queue
…and batch executes all updates


Re-renders on every change: no magical data binding, no dirty checking (like angular), no explicit dom operation

Components are declarative, and composoble. They recieve new state and re-render themselves
